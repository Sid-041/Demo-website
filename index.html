        <h2>Why habits matter more than motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Habits are the small decisions and actions we repeat every day. Over time, they quietly
          compound—either working <strong>for</strong> you or <strong>against</strong> you. Atomic Habits
          explains that progress is less about intense bursts of motivation and more about
          <strong>designing systems</strong> that make the right actions easier. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid three">
        <article class="info-card">
          <h3>1% better, every day</h3>
          <p>
            Improving just a little bit each day may not look impressive in the short term, but it
            compounds. Small wins accumulate into meaningful change, just like interest grows in a
            savings account.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h3>Systems over goals</h3>
          <p>
            Goals define the results you want, but systems are the processes that lead there. James Clear
            suggests that focusing on <strong>better systems</strong> is more reliable than obsessing over
            final outcomes. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h3>Identity-based habits</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of asking “What do I want to achieve?”, ask “<strong>Who do I want to become?</strong>”
            You reinforce that identity every time you act in line with it—for example, “I am a person who
            moves my body daily.” :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

      <div class="section-header">
        <h2>Core ideas from Atomic Habits</h2>
        <p>
          Below are simplified versions of some of the key concepts James Clear explores in his writing,
          including the book and articles on habit formation. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid two">
        <article class="info-card">
          <h3>The habit loop</h3>
          <p>
            Habits follow a repeating loop:
          </p>
          <ol class="numbered">
            <li><strong>Cue</strong> – something triggers your brain to start a behaviour.</li>
            <li><strong>Craving</strong> – you want a state change (feel energized, relaxed, satisfied).</li>
            <li><strong>Response</strong> – you take an action (the habit itself).</li>
            <li><strong>Reward</strong> – you get a benefit, which teaches your brain to repeat it. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Understanding this loop helps you re-engineer habits instead of blaming willpower.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h3>The Four Laws of Behavior Change</h3>
          <p>
            To build good habits, design your environment and routines using four simple laws:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Make it obvious</strong> – keep cues visible and clear.</li>
            <li><strong>Make it attractive</strong> – link habits to things you already enjoy.</li>
            <li><strong>Make it easy</strong> – start with very small, friction-free actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Make it satisfying</strong> – give yourself a small, immediate reward. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can reverse these ideas to reduce bad habits: make them invisible, unattractive,
            difficult, and unsatisfying.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h3>Habit stacking & environment design</h3>
          <p>
            One practical technique is <strong>habit stacking</strong>: attach a new habit to something you
            already do. For example, “After I make my morning tea, I will read one page.” :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
          </p>
          <p>
            Environment design means shaping your surroundings so that good habits are the default:
            keeping healthy snacks visible, putting your phone in another room while working, or laying
            out your workout clothes the night before.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="info-card">
          <h3>Tracking and reflecting</h3>
          <p>
            Tracking habits with a simple checklist or app makes progress visible and satisfying. Each
            tick mark is a small reward that encourages consistency. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
          </p>
          <p>
            Periodic reflection—asking “What is working? What feels hard?”—helps you adjust your system
            instead of giving up completely.
